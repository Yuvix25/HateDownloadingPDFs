## IMPORTANT: I have been experiencing some issues of infinite tab opening with this extension. Until I find a fix, I would highly recommned you not to use this extension. If you had that issue, and you can't disable the extension normally due to Chrome being stuck, try renaming/deleting the source folder.

# Hate Downloading PDFs!
Tired of filling up your downloads folder with garbage PDF you only wanted to open once? Say no more! With this extension, all PDFs will be opened in a new tab instead of being downloaded.

## Installation:
1. Clone this repoitory into your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable developer mode.
4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder you cloned this repository into.
5. You're done! Now all PDFs will be opened in a new tab instead of being downloaded.
